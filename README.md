## PST Dataset
The dataset can be downloaded from [BaiduPan](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1I_HZXBx7U0UsRHJL5JJagw?pwd=bft3) with password bft3, [Aliyun](https://open-data-set.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/oag-benchmark/kddcup-2024/PST/PST.zip) or [DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/namx1n55xzqil4zbkd5sv/PST.zip?rlkey=impcbm2acqmqhurv2oj0xxysx&dl=1).
The paper XML files are generated by [Grobid](https://grobid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Introduction/) APIs from paper pdfs.
And please download the DBLP-Citation-network V16 from [DBLP](https://open.aminer.cn/open/article?id=655db2202ab17a072284bc0c) and version OAG 3.1 from [OAG](https://open.aminer.cn/open/article?id=5965cf249ed5db41ed4f52bf), extract them, and place them in the data folder.
